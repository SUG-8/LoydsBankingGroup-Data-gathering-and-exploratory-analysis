# LoydsBankingGroup-Data-gathering-and-exploratory-analysis
LBG Data Science and Analysis Job Simulation TASK 1

I built an interactive churn analysis dashboard (with a lot of critical thinking!) to explore why customers are leaving SmartBank. This project focused on preparing real world customer data for predictive modeling, all done using Excel and data visualization tools.And then followed it with a report 

Key highlights:

📊 Analysis of churn based on service usage, transaction history, demographics, and customer service interactions

🧠 Custom datasets created from raw bank data to uncover deeper insights (e.g., churn by product price, interaction type, and age group)

📈 Visualizations showing patterns like high churn among older users, mobile app dissatisfaction, and poor resolution outcomes

⚙️ Preprocessing steps including data gathering and cleaning making it ready for machine learning

This project helped me sharpen my skills in data analysis, visualization, and storytelling and also gave me a real world foundation for building predictive models in Excel!
